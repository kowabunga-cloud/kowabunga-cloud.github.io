    * **KFS** and **KGW** as-as-sevices resources are now region-global, not zone-bounded anymore.
    * Resources from all zones should be able to use region's global services.

* **BREAK**: Revamped architecture
    * Introduction of n-tier architecture with **Kowabunga Agents**:
        * **KCA**: *Kowabunga Computing Agent*, locally controlling KVM/libvirt hypervisors.
        * **KNA**: *Kowabunga Networking Agent*, locally controlling Iris network gateways.
        * **KSA**: *Kowabunga Storage Agent*, locally controlling Ceph clusters.
    * Kowabunga is now split between the global, Internet-exposed orchestrator, and datacenter-local agent (KCA, KNA, KSA) instances, managing private local resources. Agents connect to orchestrator through secure WebSocket (bypassing all possible private-DC firewall issues) and gets controlled by reverse-RPC calls.
    * Typical usage workflow translates as **Terraform <-> Client SDK <-> API <-> Kowabunga Orchestrator <-> RPC <-> WSS <-> Local Agent**.
    * Both agents and orchestrator auto-detects peer's failure and automatically reconnect in a progressive manner.
    * All direct interaction from orchestrator to libvirt/Ceph/Iris is now delegated to respective agents.
    * Cloud-init ISO images are now stored on Ceph backend (distributed, ready for instances' migration) and do not require a patched version of libvirt anymore.

    * Orchestrator now features a in-memory ultra-efficient database cache (zero-copy, no garbage collection)

* **NEW**: Introduced user management features
    * Kowabunga now features users and groups of users.
    * Projects (and associated underlying resources) do not belong to anyone anymore and can only be created by users with **superAdmin** or **projectAdmin** role.
    * Users belong to one to several groups.
    * Projects are associated with groups.
    * All individuals from project's groups are allowed to access and administrate project's resources.
    * Orchestrator provides robust server-side generated API keys and user passwords, preventing user from using weak credentials
    * User are required to perform a 2-steps account validation upon creation, before being able to consume services.

* **NEW**: Introduced robust authentication mechanisms
    * Kowabunga features 3 ways to consume WebServices:
        * **admin master token** (should never be used, unless for creating first **superAdmin** users)
        * Server-to-server API key authentication
        * JWT-based bearer authentication
    * Orchestrator's HTTP router now features middleware-based API routing layers: log, authentication, authorization, processing
    * Orchestrator's HTTP router uses per API route ACLs checks.
