As infrastructure admin, we've created a few users [earlier](/docs/admin-guide/provision-users/).

Kowabunga users are part of teams (can be part of multiple ones) and have different roles:

- **superAdmin**: god-mode, in capacity to manage the whole infrastructure, as defined in [administration guide](/docs/admin-guide/) section, and create new **Kowabunga projects**.
- **projectAdmin**: in capacity to create any kind of [service resources](/docs/user-guide/services/) in the project one belongs to.
- **user**: in capacity to view and interact with the associated project's resources.

Now let's bootstrap our new [project](/docs/user-guide/create-project/) !
